# Bot redesign rounds (tools/sim.js, 864 games: 18 maps x 4/6 players x 3 levels x 8 seeds)

| round | change | result |
|---|---|---|
| baseline | current bots | Alien shuffle 20-29%, Human 12-17%; Alien win easy 35 / normal 29 / hard 41% |
| 1 | per-level memory penalty for recently visited sectors (both roles) | shuffle Alien 5-6%, Human 6-9%; win easy 28 / normal 31 / hard 42%; kept, merged (PR #38) |
| 2 | Aliens pursue Human noise announced in the last 2 turns (distance-weighted) | attacks flat (0.85/2.14/4.44 vs 0.96/2.20/4.47); win easy 32 / normal 27 / hard 39%; reverted |

Open question: attacks do not respond to noise, so the limit is probably the attack decision itself
(an Alien only strikes when a Human is in its reach this turn), not the movement.
